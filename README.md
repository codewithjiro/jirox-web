# JiroX

**Client-side web application for cleaning visual overlay artifacts from images generated by Google Gemini.**

JiroX is a lightweight, zero-backend web tool that processes Gemini-generated images entirely in the browser. It is designed specifically to clean the small corner overlay present in Gemini image outputs while preserving original resolution and image quality.

No uploads. No accounts. No server-side processing.

## Features

- **100% client-side processing**  
  All image manipulation happens locally in the browser using Canvas APIs.

- **Gemini-specific logic**  
  Tuned for the corner overlay used in Google Gemini image outputs.

- **Lossless PNG output**  
  Processed images are exported as PNG without additional compression.

- **No external dependencies at runtime**  
  Aside from Tailwind CDN and Iconify for UI, the processing engine is self-contained.

- **Fast and deterministic**  
  Pixel-level operations with predictable results on supported images.

## How it works (high level)

1. The uploaded image is drawn onto an offscreen canvas.
2. A predefined background capture (`bg_48.png` or `bg_96.png`) is used to calculate an alpha map.
3. The engine reconstructs underlying pixels by reversing the overlay blend in a fixed region.
4. The cleaned image is written back to the canvas and exported as a PNG.

This approach relies on known properties of Gemini-generated images and is **not** a general-purpose image restoration tool.
